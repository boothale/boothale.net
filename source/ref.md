Backstory
---------

In the world where Erra lives, there are two main regions.
To the north is fairly industrial land similar to Europe run by a family of crime lords.
To the south is an area similar to the Carribian and South America that is relatively lawless.

Born and raised in the north as the son of one of the more notorious criminal families.
Around the time he was 7, his father became bedridden with sickness.
Doctors told his father the sickness could return at any time but worse.
When faced with his own mortality, his father started planning a successor.
This was originally his older brother who was already participating in the affairs of the family.
When he was still young, the brother was unfortunately assassinated by a rival family.
Around this time Erra came out as transgender and began transitioning to male.
Erra was forced to step up as his fathers heir and started training on how to run a criminal empire.
He attended a very good private school and did well in his studies.
When he turned 18 was brought into the running of the family affairs,
in particular he commanded a group of hired killers/muscle.
On the surface, he did his duties well but secretly had MAJOR moral issues.

Six months into the new job, he was fed up and began planning his exit from the family.
Around the time he turned 19, father was hosting a private dinner party.
Not knowing Erra was listening, he made a comment along the lines of:
"I took a weakling and made him into the man he is today.  He'll do whatever I say."
Erra took this to mean that his father thought he had tricked him into
transitioning and had been living vicariously by controlling his actions.
This pissed Erra the fuck off and he put his exit plan into action.
After strong arming the butler into giving him transport to the harbor,
he faked his death using the body of man killed earlier that day and
stowed away on a boat heading south.

Once he reached the south he joined up with a group of smugglers.
Decided to keep his first name but changed his last name to Boothale.
Befriended a fellow sailor named Brett and over time, developed a relationship.
He also began rising through the ranks due to his criminal training.
Eventually became captain of a ship and started planning his eventual return to the north...
